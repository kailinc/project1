# tic-tac-toe
Project 1

Hey!

I created a Tic Tac Toe Game. If you're interested in playing, you can sign up and create an account. Remember your credentials, in case you ever want to play at a later time, your game history is saved to the server.

A user must sign in before game play can begin. When you are ready to play click the 'Start Game' button. X is the default player and goes first. Then hand the game over to a friend and it's O's turn.

When 3 symbols are placed in a row a pop-up will alert the users of a victory! After a victor is announced the board will reset. If choose to, you can reset the board at any time using the reset button. Once the board is cleared, you can press 'Start Game' to play another game!

Don't forget to sign out so that other users can use the game after you. Below you will find some of the technical details that went into building the game.

Thanks for playing!
